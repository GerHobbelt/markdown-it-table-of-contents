# @asdofindia/markdown-it-table-of-contents

This is a fork of [Oktavilla's markdown-it-table-of-contents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-table-of-contents) that changes the default header levels included to [1, 2, 3, 4].

That's all it does.

(I had to do this because I couldn't set options in pug's template that uses jstransformer-markdown-it which calls markdown-it without setting options)
